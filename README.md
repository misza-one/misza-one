- # Professional Vibecoder™ & Certified Code Whisperer

*Coding by astrology, debugging by interpretive dance*

Welcome to my chaotic digital kingdom where naming conventions go to die and my commit messages read like a fever dream. I don’t just write code—I channel it through my chakras and hope the JavaScript gods are feeling merciful.

## What I Do (Allegedly)

- Turn existential dread into React components
- Practice advanced console.log archaeology
- Commit directly to main while maintaining unblinking eye contact
- Name variables after my ex’s pets out of spite
- Use Stack Overflow the way normal people use therapy
- Write CSS that works until you breathe on it wrong
- Hold séances for my dead branches

## My Totally Professional Stack

- **Frontend**: React, but make it ✨emotional✨
- **Backend**: Node.js held together by duct tape and delusion
- **Database**: PostgreSQL when I’m feeling fancy, Excel when I’m not
- **Version Control**: `git commit -m "please work" --force`
- **IDE**: VS Code themed like a vaporwave nightmare
- **Testing**: Production is my test environment 😎

## Current Vibe Status

🎯 Building apps that work perfectly until someone else tries to use them  
🔮 Solving bugs by switching laptops and hoping for the best  
🎨 Creating UIs that look like a unicorn exploded (intentionally)  
📚 Documentation is just fan fiction for code  
🕳️ Stuck in callback hell, send snacks  
🎪 Currently debugging something that worked yesterday (this is fine)

## Recent Achievements

- 🏆 Made a div center itself through sheer force of will
- 🥇 Broke production on a Friday at 4:59 PM (personal record)
- 🎖️ Successfully copied code from Stack Overflow without reading it first
- 👑 Convinced myself `!important` is a design pattern

**Legal Disclaimer**: My code works on my machine, my mom’s machine, and surprisingly well on my toaster. Not responsible for: spontaneous crashes, existential crises, or the sudden urge to become a goat farmer. If your code starts working after looking at mine, that’s not a coincidence—that’s a miracle. 🙏--->
